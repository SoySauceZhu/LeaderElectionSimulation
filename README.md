# LeaderElectionSimulation

This is the code for COMP212 Distributed System assignment 1 at University of Liverpool.

## Project Structure

- `src/entity/lcr/LCRNode.java`: Contains the implementation of the LCR (Le Lann, Chang, and Roberts) algorithm for leader election.
- `src/entity/common/Node.java`: Base class for nodes in the distributed system.
- `src/entity/common/Message.java`: Represents messages exchanged between nodes.
- `src/entity/common/MessageType.java`: Enum defining different types of messages.
- `src/entity/common/NodeType.java`: Enum defining different types of nodes.
- `output.json`: Example output file containing JSON data generated by the simulation.

## LCRNode Class

The `LCRNode` class extends the `Node` class and implements the LCR algorithm for leader election. It overrides the `start` and `processMessages` methods to handle the election process.

## NodeType Enum

The `NodeType` enum defines the possible types of nodes in the system:
- `UNKNOWN`
- `SUBORDINATE`
- `LEADER`

## Example Output

The `output.json` file contains example data generated by the simulation. Each entry in the JSON array represents the state of a node at a given point in time.

## Dependencies

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the project, use the following commands:

```sh
javac -d bin src/entity/common/*.java src/entity/lcr/*.java
java -cp bin entity.lcr.LCRNode
```
## Artifacts Usage

- To run the interactive simulator, run

```shell
java -jar out/artifacts/Assignment1_jar/Assignment1.jar
```

- To run the statistic simulator, run
```sh
java -jar out/artifacts/Assignment1_stat_jar/Assignment1.jar
```
